##Test Features


###Selenium Browser Tests
Selenium browser tests focus on Merchello features only. If an issue is in .Net, Umbraco, a NuGet Package, or any other dependecy, these tests will not focus on or find those issues. 

Feel free to record your own tests via the Selenium FireFox Browser IDE, then save as WebDriver files. You can then convert these webdriver files into tests for this starter site.
