Samples
=======

These projects are samples of using Merchello Commerce services. 


##Kitchen
The Kitchen site is a copy of a real site in development at Mindfly.com. The site is not complete. Be prepared to track down issues or ignore them. This site depends heavily on Merchello and is a hybrid site via the Buzz library. 

##Rosetta
This is the original Rosetta sample site used for the Code Garden presentation. It was never finished so it has many places it could be improved and completed. It is not a hybrid site but a more typical/beginner Umbraco site.

##How-To-Articles
Each project in the How-To section is meant to show a single feature or process. It is not a hybrid site.
