##How-Tos
The how-to projects are meant to be very small - showing you a very specific task or feature. Please read the associated how-to article at [merchello.com](http://merchello.com/documentation/getting-started/how-to/).

##Kitten Starter
The kitten starter is no longer part of the samples. The Merchello Bazaar, an installable Umbraco package, is now the starter. 

You can find the download of the Merchello Bazaar on the our.Umbraco.org page for Merchello.
