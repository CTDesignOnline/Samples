Samples
=======

These projects are samples of using Merchello Commerce services. 

##Rosetta
This is the original Rosetta sample site used for the Code Garden presentation. It was never finished so it has many places it could be improved and completed. It is not a hybrid site but a more typical/beginner Umbraco site.

##How-To-Articles
Each project in the How-To section is meant to show a single feature or process. It is not a hybrid site. 


##Updates
2014 December 12: Archived Kitchen (hybrid) site. Rosetta will be starter/template moving forward.
