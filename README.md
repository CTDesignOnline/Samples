##How-Tos
The how-to projects are meant to be very small - showing you a very specific task or feature. Please read the associated how-to article at [merchello.com](http://merchello.com/documentation/getting-started/how-to/).

##Kitten Starter
The Kitten site is the beginning of a great starter kit. The site features product selection with options, a basket/shopping cart, and a checkout process. Feel free to take the starter as a beginning site. Or look at the code as an example of what you can do with Merchello.
